# Flutter Learning Jourey

Welcome to my Flutter learning repository. Here's a breakdown of what I've been working on:

- **learning1:** Basic concepts and fundamentals of Flutter.
- **demo_pages:** Self-created pages to practice and showcase what I've learned.
- **firebase_projects:** Implementation of Firebase into Flutter projects.
- **ecommerce_app:** Learning how to start and build a Flutter project from scratch.

I know it might seem a bit complicated, but I'm learning and improving every day. Thank you for visiting my repository!
