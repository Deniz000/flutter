## E-commerce App Practice

### Overview
In this project, I focused on the critical preliminary steps required before starting a new project. I have learned the importance of making decisions about fonts, themes, sizes, device features, and helpful tools at the outset. 

### Key Learnings
One of the most important insights I gained is that preparing the project for development—such as deciding on sizes and text styles—is just as crucial as the rest of the project. Proper planning and setup are essential for a successful development process.
